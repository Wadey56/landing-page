# Landing Page

This project consisted of a series of HTML and CSS-related tasks to replicate a layout provided by The Odin Project.

I committed each time I styled a section of the page to keep a log of progress over time and get used to regular commits with short messages.

The directory and file creation and navigation, as well as git commands for that matter, have all been done within my terminal or built in terminal provided by VSCode to build muscle memory.

The resources provided, and by extension this project, have made me confident with the use of flex-box and its respective properties to manipulate the DOM. This has been my first attempt at building (replicating) a CSS layout via an image without the use of a CSS library and I am pleased with the result.

I can confidently use these skills to repeat the process of breaking down a webpage's HTML elements and style them.
